# FHIRCat - Enabling the Semantics of FHIR and Terminologies for Clinical and Translational Research 

## Specific Aims

The objective of this project is to design, develop and evaluate a novel informatics platform known as **FHIRCat** that leverages Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies, FHIR models/profiles, and ontologies for effective standards-based data integration and distributed analytics, enabling high-quality reproducible clinical and translational research. Our specific aims are:

**Aim 1: Develop FHIR ShEx/RDF specification and tools for FHIR data validation.** We will (a) develop the FHIR RDF stack to represent the core FHIR model, the FHIR constraint language, the FHIR extension model, and the FHIR "slicing" language in ShEx, a concise, human-readable, computable constraint language; (b) incorporate the ShEx/RDF specification as a normative part of the FHIR specification; and (c) publish, disseminate, and promote the RDF technology and associated tools throughout the wider FHIR community, with the goal of broad availability and utility of semantic clinical information. 


This work is supported by funding from NIH BD2K (U01 HG009450) and FHIRCat (R56 EB028101).
