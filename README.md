# FHIRCat - Enabling the Semantics of FHIR and Terminologies for Clinical and Translational Research 

## Specific Aims

The objective of this project is to design, develop and evaluate a novel informatics platform known as **FHIRCat** that leverages Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies, FHIR models/profiles, and ontologies for effective standards-based data integration and distributed analytics, enabling high-quality reproducible clinical and translational research. Our specific aims are:

* Aim 1: Develop FHIR ShEx/RDF specification and tools for FHIR data validation.
* Aim 2: Standardize and deploy the RDF-based data transformation between external models and FHIR.
* Aim 3: Build and evaluate a FHIR ontology-based data access (OBDA) system interoperable with clinical data repositories across institutions in partnership with the CTSA National Center for Data to Health (CD2H).


This work is supported by funding from NIH BD2K (U01 HG009450) and FHIRCat (R56 EB028101, R01 EB030529).
